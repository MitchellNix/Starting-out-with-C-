# Starting-out-with-C-
This repository is a collection of some sample solutions to problems 
from the book "Starting out with C++ from control structures through objects" By Tony Gaddis.

Each file is a stand alone .cpp file. While the requirements from the book are met, these exercises are not intended as stand alone programs and in many cases have not come equiped with exeption handling, or code to handle anomalous events.

If you are currently enrolled in a course that uses this textbook you are NOT AUTHORIZED TO SUBMIT THIS WORK AS YOUR OWN.
These example solutions can be used as a reference for the course only.
